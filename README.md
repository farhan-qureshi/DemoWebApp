# DemoWebApp
This is a sample ASP.NET MVC Web App that can be used to call the DemoAPI for subscription, pulling content, getting all interests specific for the user and unsubscribe. 
Once subscribed, the content is pulled from the API and a slack message is sent.

more to do
- need to make ability to change slack web hook. Currently it is hard coded.
- ability for user to login. Currently hard coded to a database value.
